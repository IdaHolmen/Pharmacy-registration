This project is a Pharmacy Inventory Manager which is used to register medicines.

On the top part of the screen there are two tabs which let's the user switch between registering the medicines and viewing them.

In the Display Medicine List you can filter through the registered medicines and view them by medicine type.
This is a project with focus on Object-oriented programming.
I have used a Medicine class that all the medicine types inherit data from and the data is stored in Local Storage.
